# Customer Segmentation & Predictive Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using customer segmentation and predictive analytics techniques to enhance marketing strategies in e-commerce. By segmenting customers based on their purchase behaviors and predicting future purchasing trends, this system provides tailored product recommendations, improving customer engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty.

## Objectives
- Segment customers effectively using transactional data.
- Forecast future customer spending and purchasing patterns.
- Enhance customer targeting with personalized recommendations.

## Key Techniques
- **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised learning method for identifying distinct customer segments.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction technique for data visualization and analysis.
- **Linear Regression**: Predictive modeling for forecasting customer spending.

## Features
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Utilizing historical data to predict future customer behavior and spending.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Providing tailored product suggestions based on cluster-specific trends.
